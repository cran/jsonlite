Description: This package is a fork of the RJSONIO package by Duncan Temple
    Lang. It builds on the same libjson c++ parser, but implements a smarter
    mapping between R objects and JSON strings. The package vignette describes
    the behavior in great detail. In addition to drop-in replacements for
    fromJSON and toJSON, the package has functions to serialize objects. The
    package also contains many unit tests to make verify that all edge cases
    are encoded and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems
    and applications.
Suggests: testthat, knitr, reshape2, httr

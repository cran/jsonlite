Description: This package is a fork of the RJSONIO package by Duncan Temple
    Lang. It builds on the same libjson c++ parser, but implements a smarter
    mapping between JSON data and R classes. The vignette describes
    the behavior in great detail. In addition to drop-in replacements for
    toJSON and fromJSON, the package contains functions to serialize objects
    and many unit tests to make verify that all edge cases are encoded and 
    decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
Suggests: testthat, knitr, reshape2, httr
